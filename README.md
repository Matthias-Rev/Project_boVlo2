User Manual

This User manual is separated in different sections, depending on which button you click on.

1. Orders

The first button on the top left “ORDERS”, gives you an access to the database where all the commands are logged. These commands from your clients are separated in different cowls, where you can find: the society, the date of order, the delivered date and finally the state of this one.
The search bar can filter the desired command by its idOrder, or you can click on “view details” to access these command details.
The second table will show the command details, where you can find the different bought bikes, their colours, their sizes and finally the quantity.

2. CATALOG

The Catalog button is used by the market team, to take care of the client commands.
First select the desired bike, you can switch between the range of bikes offered by Bovélo.
The price per unit is written just under the bike name, then you can select the size of the wheels, the colour and finally the quantity.
Then press “Add” and the desired command will be added to the basket section. When the selection is finished, click on “Basket”.
Upon clicking on the basket button, the command is resumed in a table with the different features (colour, wheel size,...). Furthermore, the total price is shown with the estimated delivery date.
You can return to the catalog again or finish your command if it’s validated.
If you click on the finish button, you arrive to the last part of the command. If you’re already a client, you can write your VAT number and the command will be added to your count. If it’s the first time that you buy bikes to Bovélo, you must fill in the adequate information (VAT, name, address,...).

3. CALENDAR

The calendar section helps to organize and visualize the commands.
A filter allows to show only the commands that must be finished. Though the other commands with a status “Done” are kept in the database for a history.
If the production doesn’t follow the predicted calendar, the workers can adapt the delivered date. To do so, you can easily change every information. Click on the case that you want to change, change the information and press enter.
The Calendar will refresh itself with the newest information.
To validate a command, click on the “Validate” button. This action will change the status command from “To Do” to “Done”.

4. SUPPLY

 The supply section is linked with the database that takes care of the storage of every piece or bikes that are stored by the society.
You can find two different tabs, one for the part that is used to produce the bike (wheel, fork, tyre,...) and the other one is the bike already stored and finished.
If some part is needed, you can click on “Order more”. This button will show you another table with the pieces that you can order, write how many pieces of a certain type that you want to order. Finally, click on “Generate Order”.
For the bike tab, you can filter the bikes with their type, colour, and size.
